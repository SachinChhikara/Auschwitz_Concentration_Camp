## Introduction

World war II, where many different nationality were considered inferior to the Aryan
race(German people), which cause many to captured and send to Concentration Camp.
One of the most popular concentration camp was Auschwitz, where many were captured and killed. In this paper, we will go over the motivation to view and write about this horrific event that occurred in history and observe the data about this.

## Motivation

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
